1. In terms of maths, Bracket sequence [((())()(())]] may be incorrect because of:
    - Case 1. Missing opening and closing brackets.
    - Case 2. Extra opening and closing brackets.
2. To make it right, it needs to:
    - Case 1. Add the missing opening and closing brackets. In this case, corrected bracket sequence is [[((()()()(())))]].
    - Case 2. Delete the extra opening and closing brackets. In this case, corrected bracket sequence is [((()()))].
